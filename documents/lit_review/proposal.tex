\begin{abstract} In this paper, we investigate algorithms that perform two-view and multi-view feature matching and reconstruction. The algorithms, namely the eight-point algorithm, the factorization algorithm, and the two-view triangulation as in \cite{ma2012invitation}. Data points from image sets depicting a city and house are used. The reconstructions after applying the algorithms are re-projected onto the original image/model and a re-projection error is calculated to evaluate performance. We found best performance with the two-view 8-point algorithm with a re-projection error of 4, while the four-view reconstruction had an error of 1624. In other words, least error was observed in two-view reconstruction, while most error was observed in multi-view reconstruction.
