\begin{abstract}
This document is for writing about the papers we find. Currently the plan is to do control of boats.
\end{abstract}

\section{Questions}
We want lane-keeping for boats. Are we doing sailboats or motorboats?
\section{Glossary}
\begin{itemize}
    \item USV (unmanned surface vehicles)
    \item COLREGS are rules for avoiding collisions with boats
    \item underactuated vs. fully-actuated. I believe this refers to if we can go in an arbitrary direction  \href{https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-832-underactuated-robotics-spring-2009/readings/MIT6_832s09_read_ch01.pdf}{source}
\end{itemize}

\section{Papers}
\subsection{Fuzzy Guidance Controller for an Autonomous Boat}
\cite{Vaneck1997} An old paper on waypoint following.


\subsection{Dynamic simulation model for an autonomous sailboat}
\cite{Buehler2018} This paper derives a dynamic model for a sailboat. There is a \href{https://github.com/simonkohaut/stda-sailboat-simulator/tree/master/src}{GitHub repo} with their Python simulation.


\section{Control}
\cite{Nan2020} Uses robust PID control of unknown USVs. So robust control with uncertainties.
\cite{Tan2010} Criteria and rule based obstacle avoidance for USVs explains some path-planning for boats. Splits the process into two parts: a big plan and then a local plan. It explicitly mentions lane keeping.
\section{Navigation}

\section{Models}
\cite{Huang2017} Tries to figure out how close a boat model is from reality. Inconclusive, they only do preliminary work. Further work could be done, but it probably requires a real life boat.

\cite{Setiawan2020} Tries to make a dynamic model of autonomous sailboat.
