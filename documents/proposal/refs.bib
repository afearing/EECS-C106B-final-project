abstract = {Barrier functions (also called certificates) have been an important tool for the verification of hybrid systems, and have also played important roles in optimization and multi-objective control. The extension of a barrier function to a controlled system results in a control barrier function. This can be thought of as being analogous to how Sontag extended Lyapunov functions to control Lypaunov functions in order to enable controller synthesis for stabilization tasks. A control barrier function enables controller synthesis for safety requirements specified by forward invariance of a set using a Lyapunov-like condition. This paper develops several important extensions to the notion of a control barrier function. The first involves robustness under perturbations to the vector field defining the system. Input-to-State stability conditions are given that provide for forward invariance, when disturbances are present, of a "relaxation" of set rendered invariant without disturbances. A control barrier function can be combined with a control Lyapunov function in a quadratic program to achieve a control objective subject to safety guarantees. The second result of the paper gives conditions for the control law obtained by solving the quadratic program to be Lipschitz continuous and therefore to gives rise to well-defined solutions of the resulting closed-loop system.},

abstract = {This paper presents initial results towards a real-izable framework for the safety critical controlled invariance of cyber-physical systems. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a control barrier function based methodology which can be used to enforce set invariance on systems in the presence of non-linear disturbances and uncertainty. The first part of this work is a review of the current methods available for finding viable sets and how they are linked to practical choices regarding safety. Their limitations and directions towards improvements when it comes to handling model uncertainty are also highlighted. The second part of this work is the formulation of a condition which can guarantee set invariance in the presence of generic uncertain in the dynamics. An associated optimization problem to enforce that condition is proposed and a method to convexify the problem and make it solvable in real-time is formally presented. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is illustrated experimentally on a two-wheeled inverted pendulum.},

abstract = {Legged locomotion is a very important mode of transportation. Even though wheeled and tracked vehicles (which do not appear in nature) can be quicker and more effi- cient in some situations, they are likely to be able to reach only about 50% of the terrestrial world. Legs can reach a much larger percentage, with the only real limita- tions coming from safety and unhabitable conditions. Biomimetics is the application of principles learned in biological systems to manmade systems. The Sprawl family of robots built in our lab are inspired by research done on cockroaches and other agile runners. The performance of these robots has been improved by steady analysis and development cycles focused on many aspects of the robot. These studies have led to design improvements and robot parameter tuning that achieves the best perfor- mance from the various versions of the family. However, prior to this research, the area of maneuverability had been overlooked. Without maneuverability, these robots are limited to only straight ahead speed and stability investigations; and in actuality robot experimentation primarily took place on a narrow 5 foot long treadmill. The experiments are far from trivial, but with maneuverability these studies gain addi- tional real-world applicability. Biologists investigations have given key insight into the ways that cockroaches run and turn. Cockroaches maintain an alternating tripod gait, but shift the foot placement and sweep angle of the legs in order to change the turning moment about their center of mass. Because of their performance and versatility, the Sprawlettes and iSprawl, two members of the Sprawl family, serve as a good platforms to study biomimetic inspired maneuvers. In this thesis, the dynamic maneuverability of the Sprawlettes is thoroughly in- vestigated. First, the available parameters are evaluated for their effectiveness using Design of Experiment techniques, and narrowed down to ipsilateral leg angles. The workspace and use of these parameters was examined to enable these 3 parameters to be further reduced to a single turnfactor variable which moves smoothly through the workspace and provides a great range of turning behavior. This analysis involved experiments on the robots and in simulation to help expedite the process. As iSprawl came to fruition, it was included in many of these analyses for comparison and more insight on legged maneuverability. System identification techniques have been applied to help identify bandwidth limitations (around 1-3Hz for both systems) and charac- terize the turning dynamics. The similarities and differences in the Sprawlettes and iSprawl have contributed to the understanding and explanation of turning behavior for dynamic legged robots. Using the information gained in the process, dynamic maneuverability concepts were developed and tested to aid future investigations in this relatively new field.},

abstract = {Since Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) are relatively light weight and have a large windage area, they are sensitive to wind disturbances, especially during station-keeping operations. While robust feedback controllers can be used to attenuate slowly changing wind disturbances, they have difficulty compensating for the rapid variation of wind speed and direction. Control and sensing strategies were developed to mitigate wind effects on a 4.9 meter long, 180 kg USV. A wind feed-forward controller was designed using an anemometer to measure the apparent wind speed/direction and a wind model to estimate the wind-induced forces and moments on the USV in real-time. Freely drifting tests were performed to evaluate the impact of the wind on an unpowered USV. The vehicle was blown more than 20 meters off station in 5 minutes in mean wind speeds of about 2m/s. Experiments also showed that the response time of the USV to wind gusts is about 5 seconds. The wind feedforward feature was added to different station-keeping feedback controllers, namely a PD controller, a robust backstepping controller, and a sliding mode controller. Station keeping tests of those controllers without/ with wind feedforward controller were conducted and repeated for 5 times. The experimental results showed that the small size of USV can gain significant benefits from the inclusion of wind feedforward feature in both position and heading by an average of 75%, and 46% respectively in 5 sets of station keeping experiments.},

abstract = {This paper develops a novel path following control strategy for the path following of underactuated unmanned surface vehicle (USV) under the unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. The proposed controller is designed using trajectory linearization control and fuzzy disturbance observer (FDO). First, trajectory linearization control is introduced into the field of ship motion control, which is an effective control method for solving nonlinear tracking and system decoupling. Second, the nonlinear coordinate transformation is constructed to solve underactuated model problems, which will result in a “global design”. Then, to enhance performance and robustness of the system, FDO is designed to estimate the unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances to achieve real-time online compensation, and robust control term can overcome the influence of approximation error. It is proved that all error signals in the system are uniformly ultimately bounded by Lyapunov functions. At last, comparisons and simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed control strategy.},

abstract = {Sailing without any human intervention generates a great fascination, since it is challenging while enabling many opportunities. Moving without external energy supply, possibly transporting goods, collecting plastic waste or recording scientific measurement data, new attractive scenarios become possible. As first milestone, we aim to send a robotic sailboat across the Atlantic ocean, coping with bad weather including storms, other vessels or floating waste. For testing, designing control, sophisticated route planning, and managing algorithms, we are interested in differential equations for a simulation model. Therefore, we theoretically derive relations, describing the sailboat motion as those of a rigid body having six degrees of freedom (6 DOF). This allows us to reproduce significant nonlinear effects like the ones created by flow separation, speed dependence of the dynamics and oscillations by waves, while maintaining a comprehensible structure of the external forces of the sailboat. In contrast to standard velocity prediction programs (VPP), we are interested in the actual dynamical behavior, the effect of sail angles, rudder and waves while the precise prediction of the actual reachable velocities are of minor interest. The dynamic model can serve for controller design and for the generation of test data. Additionally, it is used to feed a hardware model of our boat, providing an intuitive way of demonstrating the boat movements.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This paper presents a Learning-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (LB-NMPC) algorithm for reconfigurable autonomous vessels to facilitate high-accurate path tracking. Each vessel is designed to latch to a pre-defined point of another vessel that allows the vessels to form a rigid body. The number of possible configurations of such vessels exponentially grows as the total number of vessels increases, which imposes a technical challenge in modeling and identification. In this work, we propose a framework consisting of a real-time parameter estimator and a feedback control strategy, which is capable of ensuring high-accurate path tracking for any feasible configuration of vessels. Novelty of our method is in that the parameter is estimated on-line and adjusts control parameters (e.g., cost function and dynamic model) simultaneously to improve path-tracking performance. Through experiments on different configurations of connected-vessels, we demonstrate stability of our proposed approach and its effectiveness in high-accuracy in path tracking.},

abstract = {Recently, multi-sensor navigation has emerged as a viable approach in autonomous vehicles' development. Kalman filtering has been widely applied in multi-sensor data fusion, and researchers are trialing variants of the Kalman Filter (KF) to improve the operational robustness of vehicles in a range of environments under varying dynamic constraints. This paper proposes a novel sensor data fusion algorithm employing an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for the autonomous navigation of an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV). Since the navigational sensors on-board the USV are subject to operational uncertainties caused by equipment limitations and environmental disturbances, an improved UKF algorithm with the capability of adaptive estimation, namely fuzzy adaptive UKF data fusion algorithm, has been proposed to obtain reliable navigational information. The conventional UKF is capable of fusing a number of raw sensor measurements and generating relatively accurate estimations with proper a priori knowledge of system noise. To deal with systems that lack such information, a fuzzy adaptive estimation method is introduced to enhance the performance of the conventional UKF, making the algorithm capable of verifying and correcting the associated sensor noise in real time. The proposed fuzzy adaptive UKF data fusion algorithm has been tested and evaluated in different simulations modeled using practical maritime environments and the results are compared with the conventional UKF. The sensor measurements taken from a practical USV trial have also been applied to the proposed algorithm for further validation.},

The vehicles are subject to time-varying external disturbances, and the vehicle dynamics include both parametric uncertainties and uncertain nonlinear functions. The control objective is to make each vehicle follow its reference trajectory and avoid collision between each vehicle and its leader. We consider prescribed performance constraints, including transient and steady-state performance constraints, on formation tracking errors. In the kinematic design, we introduce the dynamic surface control technique to avoid the use of vehicle's acceleration. To compensate for the uncertainties and disturbances, we apply an adaptive control technique to estimate the uncertain parameters including the upper bounds of the disturbances and present neural network approximators to estimate uncertain nonlinear dynamics. Consequently, we design a decentralized adaptive formation controller that ensures uniformly ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system with prescribed performance and avoids collision between each vehicle and its leader. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the decentralized formation controller.},

The purpose of this study is to experimentally study the aerodynamic performance of a 1/4th scale wing sail by varying the flap angle in a laboratory set-up. The aerodynamic of wing sail produces lift and drag forces that depend on the wing sail angle of attack. In this study, an encoder is used to measure the angle of attack of wing sail, a potentiometer for measuring the flap angle, and an anemometer for measuring the wind speed. A servo motor is used for controlling the flap angle. The digital data acquisition uses Arduino Uno as the microcontroller which is wired to a PC and coded in MATLAB/Simulink using Arduino package. The experiment results show the wing sail performance, the effect varying flap angles. The total aerodynamic forces were generated in this experiment.},
