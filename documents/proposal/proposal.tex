\begin{abstract}
We're going to do some controls
\end{abstract}


\section{About Us}
Neelay is a 4th year undergraduate in EECS, and has taken courses such as EE 128, 221A/222, and (of course) EECS 106A. His interests are primarily related to control and motion planning.

Andrew is a 4th year undergraduate in EECS. He has taken EE 120, EE C128, and EECS C106A. His interests in robotics are in micro-scale mobile robots.
\section{Research Question}
Can we control a boat so that it keeps its lane? Autonomously navigate a canal.
\section{Motivation}
Boat stuck.

Control and safety of automobiles is an area of intense research focus. We want to try applying the same techniques to a different system: autonomous boats, or in engineering terms, \enquote{Unmanned Surface Vehicles}.
\section{Proposed Methodology}
We plan to use simulation to quantify the performance of our control scheme. We will examine literature in USV's.
\section{Related Work}
There is already work in the area of of USV's.

\cite{Setiawan2020} and \cite{Buehler2018} develop a dynamic models of an autonomous sailboats, though they do not go into the application of controls.




\section{Experimental Plan}
Using a dynamic model as that proposed in \cite{Buehler2018}, we will simulate and analyze the performance of our control scheme.
