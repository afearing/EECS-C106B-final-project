AVALON's purpose is to cross the Atlantic Ocean completely au- tonomously without any direct influence by humans. The system's robustness and stability are as important as an acceptable sailing performance. The entire mechanical and electronic system was developed in order to fulfill that single purpose and take up the challenge. I.},

abstract = {Legged locomotion is a very important mode of transportation. Even though wheeled and tracked vehicles (which do not appear in nature) can be quicker and more effi- cient in some situations, they are likely to be able to reach only about 50% of the terrestrial world. Legs can reach a much larger percentage, with the only real limita- tions coming from safety and unhabitable conditions. Biomimetics is the application of principles learned in biological systems to manmade systems. The Sprawl family of robots built in our lab are inspired by research done on cockroaches and other agile runners. The performance of these robots has been improved by steady analysis and development cycles focused on many aspects of the robot. These studies have led to design improvements and robot parameter tuning that achieves the best perfor- mance from the various versions of the family. However, prior to this research, the area of maneuverability had been overlooked. Without maneuverability, these robots are limited to only straight ahead speed and stability investigations; and in actuality robot experimentation primarily took place on a narrow 5 foot long treadmill. The experiments are far from trivial, but with maneuverability these studies gain addi- tional real-world applicability. Biologists investigations have given key insight into the ways that cockroaches run and turn. Cockroaches maintain an alternating tripod gait, but shift the foot placement and sweep angle of the legs in order to change the turning moment about their center of mass. Because of their performance and versatility, the Sprawlettes and iSprawl, two members of the Sprawl family, serve as a good platforms to study biomimetic inspired maneuvers. In this thesis, the dynamic maneuverability of the Sprawlettes is thoroughly in- vestigated. First, the available parameters are evaluated for their effectiveness using Design of Experiment techniques, and narrowed down to ipsilateral leg angles. The workspace and use of these parameters was examined to enable these 3 parameters to be further reduced to a single turnfactor variable which moves smoothly through the workspace and provides a great range of turning behavior. This analysis involved experiments on the robots and in simulation to help expedite the process. As iSprawl came to fruition, it was included in many of these analyses for comparison and more insight on legged maneuverability. System identification techniques have been applied to help identify bandwidth limitations (around 1-3Hz for both systems) and charac- terize the turning dynamics. The similarities and differences in the Sprawlettes and iSprawl have contributed to the understanding and explanation of turning behavior for dynamic legged robots. Using the information gained in the process, dynamic maneuverability concepts were developed and tested to aid future investigations in this relatively new field.},

abstract = {An autonomous sailboat is a robotic boat that utilizes wind energy as a booster with the ability to control its sails and steering without human intervention. An autonomous sailboat can be used for monitoring the ocean with realtime data collection and relatively easy and affordable installation. Therefore research on autonomous sailboats is important, especially for Indonesia, which has an extensive area of ocean. In this study, the autonomous boat uses wing sail with flap and rudder to produce propulsion. The simulation model of an autonomous sailboat dynamic with 4-DOF was created using MATLAB/Simulink. Simulations were carried out to determine the effect of flap and rudder deflection angles on boat dynamics. The objective of of this study is reveal the primary characteristics of boat sailboat dynamic such that the four direction combinations of the flap and rudder can steer the sailboat to the desired motion. Thus, the simulation model can be useful in formulating the in-progress control algorithm for the autonomous boat.},

abstract = {Among autonomous surface vehicles, sailing robotics could be a promising technology for long-term missions and semipersistent presence in the oceans. Autonomy of such vehicles in terms of energy will be achieved by renewable solar and wind power sources. Autonomy in terms of sailing decision will be achieved by innovative perception and navigation modules. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a complete hardware and software architecture for an autonomous sailing robot. The hardware architecture includes a comprehensive setof sensors and actuators as well as a solar panel and a wind turbine. For obstacle detection, a segmentation is performed on data coming from an omnidirectional camera coupled with an inertial measurement unit and a sonar. For navigation and control of the vehicle, a potential-based reactive path-planning approach is proposed. The specific sailboat kinematic constraints are turned into virtual obstacles to compute a feasible and optimal heading in terms of cost of gybe and tack maneuver as well as safety relative to obstacle danger. Finally, field test experiments are presented to validate the various components of the system.},

abstract = {Sailing without any human intervention generates a great fascination, since it is challenging while enabling many opportunities. Moving without external energy supply, possibly transporting goods, collecting plastic waste or recording scientific measurement data, new attractive scenarios become possible. As first milestone, we aim to send a robotic sailboat across the Atlantic ocean, coping with bad weather including storms, other vessels or floating waste. For testing, designing control, sophisticated route planning, and managing algorithms, we are interested in differential equations for a simulation model. Therefore, we theoretically derive relations, describing the sailboat motion as those of a rigid body having six degrees of freedom (6 DOF). This allows us to reproduce significant nonlinear effects like the ones created by flow separation, speed dependence of the dynamics and oscillations by waves, while maintaining a comprehensible structure of the external forces of the sailboat. In contrast to standard velocity prediction programs (VPP), we are interested in the actual dynamical behavior, the effect of sail angles, rudder and waves while the precise prediction of the actual reachable velocities are of minor interest. The dynamic model can serve for controller design and for the generation of test data. Additionally, it is used to feed a hardware model of our boat, providing an intuitive way of demonstrating the boat movements.},
