abstract = {Sailing without any human intervention generates a great fascination, since it is challenging while enabling many opportunities. Moving without external energy supply, possibly transporting goods, collecting plastic waste or recording scientific measurement data, new attractive scenarios become possible. As first milestone, we aim to send a robotic sailboat across the Atlantic ocean, coping with bad weather including storms, other vessels or floating waste. For testing, designing control, sophisticated route planning, and managing algorithms, we are interested in differential equations for a simulation model. Therefore, we theoretically derive relations, describing the sailboat motion as those of a rigid body having six degrees of freedom (6 DOF). This allows us to reproduce significant nonlinear effects like the ones created by flow separation, speed dependence of the dynamics and oscillations by waves, while maintaining a comprehensible structure of the external forces of the sailboat. In contrast to standard velocity prediction programs (VPP), we are interested in the actual dynamical behavior, the effect of sail angles, rudder and waves while the precise prediction of the actual reachable velocities are of minor interest. The dynamic model can serve for controller design and for the generation of test data. Additionally, it is used to feed a hardware model of our boat, providing an intuitive way of demonstrating the boat movements.},

abstract = {Legged locomotion is a very important mode of transportation. Even though wheeled and tracked vehicles (which do not appear in nature) can be quicker and more effi- cient in some situations, they are likely to be able to reach only about 50% of the terrestrial world. Legs can reach a much larger percentage, with the only real limita- tions coming from safety and unhabitable conditions. Biomimetics is the application of principles learned in biological systems to manmade systems. The Sprawl family of robots built in our lab are inspired by research done on cockroaches and other agile runners. The performance of these robots has been improved by steady analysis and development cycles focused on many aspects of the robot. These studies have led to design improvements and robot parameter tuning that achieves the best perfor- mance from the various versions of the family. However, prior to this research, the area of maneuverability had been overlooked. Without maneuverability, these robots are limited to only straight ahead speed and stability investigations; and in actuality robot experimentation primarily took place on a narrow 5 foot long treadmill. The experiments are far from trivial, but with maneuverability these studies gain addi- tional real-world applicability. Biologists investigations have given key insight into the ways that cockroaches run and turn. Cockroaches maintain an alternating tripod gait, but shift the foot placement and sweep angle of the legs in order to change the turning moment about their center of mass. Because of their performance and versatility, the Sprawlettes and iSprawl, two members of the Sprawl family, serve as a good platforms to study biomimetic inspired maneuvers. In this thesis, the dynamic maneuverability of the Sprawlettes is thoroughly in- vestigated. First, the available parameters are evaluated for their effectiveness using Design of Experiment techniques, and narrowed down to ipsilateral leg angles. The workspace and use of these parameters was examined to enable these 3 parameters to be further reduced to a single turnfactor variable which moves smoothly through the workspace and provides a great range of turning behavior. This analysis involved experiments on the robots and in simulation to help expedite the process. As iSprawl came to fruition, it was included in many of these analyses for comparison and more insight on legged maneuverability. System identification techniques have been applied to help identify bandwidth limitations (around 1-3Hz for both systems) and charac- terize the turning dynamics. The similarities and differences in the Sprawlettes and iSprawl have contributed to the understanding and explanation of turning behavior for dynamic legged robots. Using the information gained in the process, dynamic maneuverability concepts were developed and tested to aid future investigations in this relatively new field.},
