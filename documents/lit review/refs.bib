A look-up table controller is used to turn on and off the DC motors. Firstly it is shown how the Kalman filter algorithm was applied to estimate in real-time the boat position and heading, using the measurements from a low-cost IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), a standard GPS receiver and a digital compass. Then a mathematical model of the boat and simulation results for the sensor integration problem and for the boat controller, are discussed. Finally, the article shows how the proposed solution for the autonomous navigation problem was implemented and tested using an embedded computer and the sensors (IMU, GPS receptor and digital compass) aboard the boat. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

This autopilot is developed using a model with four degrees of freedom, which represents the dynamic of a sailboat. Due to the high nonlinearity of the developed dynamic model, heading and sail opening angle controller were developed to steer the sailboat toward a specific target position. The nonlinear four degrees of freedom dynamic model for the sailing vessel is first described. Then, an autopilot is designed using both sliding mode control and feedback linearization method. Finally, some simulations are carried out to illustrate the behavior of the overall system.},

Each vessel is designed to latch to a pre-defined point of another vessel that allows the vessels to form a rigid body. The number of possible configurations of such vessels exponentially grows as the total number of vessels increases, which imposes a technical challenge in modeling and identification. In this work, we propose a framework consisting of a real-time parameter estimator and a feedback control strategy, which is capable of ensuring high-accurate path tracking for any feasible configuration of vessels. Novelty of our method is in that the parameter is estimated on-line and adjusts control parameters (e.g., cost function and dynamic model) simultaneously to improve path-tracking performance. Through experiments on different configurations of connected-vessels, we demonstrate stability of our proposed approach and its effectiveness in high-accuracy in path tracking.},

Second, the nonlinear coordinate transformation is constructed to solve underactuated model problems, which will result in a “global design”. Then, to enhance performance and robustness of the system, FDO is designed to estimate the unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances to achieve real-time online compensation, and robust control term can overcome the influence of approximation error. It is proved that all error signals in the system are uniformly ultimately bounded by Lyapunov functions. At last, comparisons and simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed control strategy.},

The purpose of this study is to experimentally study the aerodynamic performance of a 1/4th scale wing sail by varying the flap angle in a laboratory set-up. The aerodynamic of wing sail produces lift and drag forces that depend on the wing sail angle of attack. In this study, an encoder is used to measure the angle of attack of wing sail, a potentiometer for measuring the flap angle, and an anemometer for measuring the wind speed. A servo motor is used for controlling the flap angle. The digital data acquisition uses Arduino Uno as the microcontroller which is wired to a PC and coded in MATLAB/Simulink using Arduino package. The experiment results show the wing sail performance, the effect varying flap angles. The total aerodynamic forces were generated in this experiment.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This paper presents relevant mechanical and tech- nical aspects about the autonomous sailing vessel AVALON. AVALON's purpose is to cross the Atlantic Ocean completely au- tonomously without any direct influence by humans. The system's robustness and stability are as important as an acceptable sailing performance. The entire mechanical and electronic system was developed in order to fulfill that single purpose and take up the challenge. I.},

abstract = {Legged locomotion is a very important mode of transportation. Even though wheeled and tracked vehicles (which do not appear in nature) can be quicker and more effi- cient in some situations, they are likely to be able to reach only about 50% of the terrestrial world. Legs can reach a much larger percentage, with the only real limita- tions coming from safety and unhabitable conditions. Biomimetics is the application of principles learned in biological systems to manmade systems. The Sprawl family of robots built in our lab are inspired by research done on cockroaches and other agile runners. The performance of these robots has been improved by steady analysis and development cycles focused on many aspects of the robot. These studies have led to design improvements and robot parameter tuning that achieves the best perfor- mance from the various versions of the family. However, prior to this research, the area of maneuverability had been overlooked. Without maneuverability, these robots are limited to only straight ahead speed and stability investigations; and in actuality robot experimentation primarily took place on a narrow 5 foot long treadmill. The experiments are far from trivial, but with maneuverability these studies gain addi- tional real-world applicability. Biologists investigations have given key insight into the ways that cockroaches run and turn. Cockroaches maintain an alternating tripod gait, but shift the foot placement and sweep angle of the legs in order to change the turning moment about their center of mass. Because of their performance and versatility, the Sprawlettes and iSprawl, two members of the Sprawl family, serve as a good platforms to study biomimetic inspired maneuvers. In this thesis, the dynamic maneuverability of the Sprawlettes is thoroughly in- vestigated. First, the available parameters are evaluated for their effectiveness using Design of Experiment techniques, and narrowed down to ipsilateral leg angles. The workspace and use of these parameters was examined to enable these 3 parameters to be further reduced to a single turnfactor variable which moves smoothly through the workspace and provides a great range of turning behavior. This analysis involved experiments on the robots and in simulation to help expedite the process. As iSprawl came to fruition, it was included in many of these analyses for comparison and more insight on legged maneuverability. System identification techniques have been applied to help identify bandwidth limitations (around 1-3Hz for both systems) and charac- terize the turning dynamics. The similarities and differences in the Sprawlettes and iSprawl have contributed to the understanding and explanation of turning behavior for dynamic legged robots. Using the information gained in the process, dynamic maneuverability concepts were developed and tested to aid future investigations in this relatively new field.},

abstract = {Among autonomous surface vehicles, sailing robotics could be a promising technology for long-term missions and semipersistent presence in the oceans. Autonomy of such vehicles in terms of energy will be achieved by renewable solar and wind power sources. Autonomy in terms of sailing decision will be achieved by innovative perception and navigation modules. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a complete hardware and software architecture for an autonomous sailing robot. The hardware architecture includes a comprehensive setof sensors and actuators as well as a solar panel and a wind turbine. For obstacle detection, a segmentation is performed on data coming from an omnidirectional camera coupled with an inertial measurement unit and a sonar. For navigation and control of the vehicle, a potential-based reactive path-planning approach is proposed. The specific sailboat kinematic constraints are turned into virtual obstacles to compute a feasible and optimal heading in terms of cost of gybe and tack maneuver as well as safety relative to obstacle danger. Finally, field test experiments are presented to validate the various components of the system.},

@article{Buehler2018,
abstract = {Sailing without any human intervention generates a great fascination, since it is challenging while enabling many opportunities. Moving without external energy supply, possibly transporting goods, collecting plastic waste or recording scientific measurement data, new attractive scenarios become possible. As first milestone, we aim to send a robotic sailboat across the Atlantic ocean, coping with bad weather including storms, other vessels or floating waste. For testing, designing control, sophisticated route planning, and managing algorithms, we are interested in differential equations for a simulation model. Therefore, we theoretically derive relations, describing the sailboat motion as those of a rigid body having six degrees of freedom (6 DOF). This allows us to reproduce significant nonlinear effects like the ones created by flow separation, speed dependence of the dynamics and oscillations by waves, while maintaining a comprehensible structure of the external forces of the sailboat. In contrast to standard velocity prediction programs (VPP), we are interested in the actual dynamical behavior, the effect of sail angles, rudder and waves while the precise prediction of the actual reachable velocities are of minor interest. The dynamic model can serve for controller design and for the generation of test data. Additionally, it is used to feed a hardware model of our boat, providing an intuitive way of demonstrating the boat movements.},
