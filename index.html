      Simulated Control and Path Planning of an Autonomous Sailboat

  </b> -->
We want to get a sailboat (a type of Unmanned Surface Vehicle, or USV) through a canal autonomously. The maneuver
will be performed in a simulation environment with simulated wind as the propellant for the
USV. Environmental disturbances (water currents) will also be an important factor. This work has useful implications because it
allows the deployment of navigating,
energy-efficient and green-energy sailing boats that can withstand some environmental disturbances and only use
abundant wind energy to propel themselves. These boats could be used in sea monitoring, oceanic measurement, as drifting databuouys,
as survey ships etc. This can reduce expenses and reduce deployment time, and increase data resolution.

Our control design modularizes the system into two stages: a planner, which takes in high level <i>x,y</i> position
targets and generates heading trajectories, and a yaw controller, which generates sail and rudder angles
to track the reference heading trajectory output by the planner. Since the planning stage does not need
to be run at the same rate as the yaw controller due to the slow speed of the boat, we create an inner feedback loop between the yaw controller and the system dynamics, and an outer feedback loop that incorporates the planner and is run at a lower rate.
Our paper can be found <a href="https://github.com/afearing/EECS-C106B-final-project/blob/main/documents/EECS_C106B_final_project.pdf">here</a>. <p> Our code is based on that of <a href="https://github.com/simonkohaut/stda-sailboat-simulator">
  stda-sailboat-simulator</a>. This simulator uses RK45 to solve an ODE of the sailboat dynamics over time.

Using the above path planner and controller, our simulated sailboat successfully traversed a channel to reach the target point (100, 40) with 0.5m waves. Note that the wind is blowing in the direction of sailing.

The simulation was run in several different cases. Waves, obstacles, and different wind vectors were
 used. The tests were not exhaustive due to the wide variety of environmental conditions possible at sea
  and also due to the limitations of the simulator. An experiment was deemed successful if the sailboat got
   close to the target position.

   The results demonstrated that the planner was largely successful. Passages as narrow as 4 meters were navigated through. Any narrower gaps
   caused the planner to return an infeasible path. We used:
   <ul>


     <li>  <b> Sailing with wind </b> To demonstrate that the path planning and con-trol  scheme worked,  the  target  position  was set
        to (100,40,π/4) with wind the in the direction of the intended heading, shown in Fig.3. The wind had amagnitude of5 m/s. </li>
     <li>  <b> Sailing with crosswind </b> In this experiment, the wind is changed to point at−45degrees, roughly at a right angle to
       the straight linetrajectory from start to goal. See Figure 4. </li>
     <li> <b> Sailing against Wind </b> In this experiment, the wind points at−135 degrees, andthe goal state is(x,y) = (40,40). This
       poses an interestingproblem since in the real dynamics model there is a nullwhen the boat is heading directly into the wind where
       the boat has a speed of 0. </li>
     <li> <b> Single Obstacle: </b> To demonstrate that the path planning and control scheme worked,
    the target position was set to(100,40,π/4) with wind the in the direction of the intended heading, shown in Fig.3.
    The wind had a magnitude of18 023 481 908 m/s. The boat was able to sail around the obstacle. </li>
      <li> <b>Channel: </b> Because the
    obstacle avoidance worked without a dis-turbance, waves were added to the channel traversal experiment  </li>
    <li> <b>Crosswinds: </b> The path planner was then tested with different wind directionsThe experiment was run with a
    different wind direction.Note that the sailboat overshoots the target. This was deemed acceptable because
     stopping a sailboat at a point is another issue </li>
